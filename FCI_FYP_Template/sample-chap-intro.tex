\section{Basic Introduction}
In the Introduction section, you should describe the problem investigated. Try to summarize relevant research to provide context, key terms, and concept so the reader can understand the whole final year project. Go and read journal or conference papers and review relevant past research to 
provide rational or justification for your work. Define clearly your final project objectives and briefly describe your research – design, 
research, hypothesis, etc.
